										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The pre-built websites we have launched to date address the major website types and many the most popular website niches.  We are presently looking into the needs of the increasing number of web designers who are working with small businesses.</p>
<p>Our support team has been listening to the suggestions of the design community, and we are responding to those suggestions.</p>
<p>We have launched four exciting pre-built websites this month to address the needs of web designers working in the following niche categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>BeFireplace – a delightfully beautiful shop for firewood sales;</li>
<li>Betraining – a pre-built website destined to professionals and businesses in the training and consulting sectors;</li>
<li>BeCouturier – a modern, chic pre-built website ideally suited for fashion designers;</li>
<li>BeSurveyor – destined to those in the surveying profession.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a href="http://themes.muffingroup.com/be/fireplace/"><strong>Be Fireplace</strong></a> <strong>– Keeping that Cozy Fire Ready for Winter</strong></h3>
<p>Fireplaces on homes are quite common these days. Many older homes have them, and the trend in newly-built homes is for the owner to engage the services of an interior designer for the express purpose of adding an interior or exterior fireplace.</p>
<p>Since we identified with what appears to be a growing trend, we felt companies selling firewood would benefit from the launching of this cozy-looking pre-built website.</p>
<p><a href="http://themes.muffingroup.com/be/fireplace/"><img  title="" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2792" src="http://muffingroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/1.gif"  alt="1 November – The Latest Pre-Built Websites"  width="960" height="396" /></a></p>
<p><em>This pre-built websites video header nicely conveys the beautiful and cozy experience of watching the fire</em>.</p>
<p>We wanted to find the best way to express this type of business. We decided that a video, such as the one used here, was all that was needed. Since the video is customizable, you can choose whatever one you want, to best satisfy the needs of your client.</p>
<p>This pre-built website is <em>e-commerce optimized</em>, so we added a gallery of available products right after the header to give the user an easy and satisfying UX.</p>
<p><a href="http://themes.muffingroup.com/be/fireplace/"><img  title="" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2793" src="http://muffingroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/2-3.jpg"  alt="2-3 November – The Latest Pre-Built Websites"  width="1000" height="413" srcset="https://muffingroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/2-3.jpg 1000w, https://muffingroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/2-3-700x289.jpg 700w, https://muffingroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/2-3-260x107.jpg 260w, https://muffingroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/2-3-50x21.jpg 50w, https://muffingroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/2-3-150x62.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p><em>A high level of clarity, as displayed in the product page, greatly simplifies the user’s shopping experience.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a href="http://themes.muffingroup.com/be/training/"><strong>Be Training</strong></a> <strong>– Helps Trainers Get More Visibility Online</strong></h3>
<p>When we built BeTraining, our approach was to present a clearly structured pre-built website that used only the basic pages, such as programs, an event calendar, an about page, and a contact page. We also created BeTraining with the objective of providing professional trainers and consultants, along with training agencies and larger institutions, an opportunity to increase their online visibility.</p>
<p>If the format of this versatile pre-built website suits your web design objective, well and good. You can of course customize it for <em>any </em>professional or agency that offers training, coaching, classes, workshops, etc.</p>
<p><a href="http://themes.muffingroup.com/be/training/"><img  title="" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2794" src="http://muffingroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/3-3.jpg"  alt="3-3 November – The Latest Pre-Built Websites"  width="1000" height="413" srcset="https://muffingroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/3-3.jpg 1000w, https://muffingroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/3-3-700x289.jpg 700w, https://muffingroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/3-3-260x107.jpg 260w, https://muffingroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/3-3-50x21.jpg 50w, https://muffingroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/3-3-150x62.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p><em>            This homepage provides a quick look into the most recent event section articles.</em></p>
<p>Scroll down the home page, and you’ll find an area the explains the services offered, a section about the business and its owner or owners, and a section that provides contact information, including a map. Additional sections could easily be customized to present images of from the workshop or training facility, or to describe and illustrate offline events.</p>
<p><a href="http://themes.muffingroup.com/be/training/"><img  title="" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2795" src="http://muffingroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/4-3.jpg"  alt="4-3 November – The Latest Pre-Built Websites"  width="1000" height="413" srcset="https://muffingroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/4-3.jpg 1000w, https://muffingroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/4-3-700x289.jpg 700w, https://muffingroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/4-3-260x107.jpg 260w, https://muffingroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/4-3-50x21.jpg 50w, https://muffingroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/4-3-150x62.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p><em>Showing the trainer’s services, always an important section.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a href="http://themes.muffingroup.com/be/couturier/"><strong>Be Couturier</strong></a> <strong>–  Where Fashion Meets Web Design Coolness</strong></h3>
<p>A couturier website should convey uniqueness and a feeling of luxury. We created BeCouturier because of our awareness of the rising trend in the number of people opening tailoring businesses. This is in response to a growing consumer demand for unique and attractive custom made clothes. As you would expect, our pre-built website conveys this same sense of uniqueness and luxury.</p>
<p><a href="http://themes.muffingroup.com/be/couturier/"><img  title="" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2796" src="http://muffingroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/5-3.jpg"  alt="5-3 November – The Latest Pre-Built Websites"  width="1000" height="413" srcset="https://muffingroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/5-3.jpg 1000w, https://muffingroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/5-3-700x289.jpg 700w, https://muffingroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/5-3-260x107.jpg 260w, https://muffingroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/5-3-50x21.jpg 50w, https://muffingroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/5-3-150x62.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p><em>Notice how the white space helps the user focus on the header images, while at the same time conveying a feeling of relaxation.</em></p>
<p>As you examine BeCouturier in detail, you’ll see how we generously use white space to transmit a feeling of elegance. The offer, together with other items of clothing, are on display, plus there is a section about the professional tailors that you, as a client, could be working with.</p>
<p>The pre-built structure also features a page destined to the fashion studio itself, where photos can be added along with the studio’s story. A gallery with realizations, a page communicating the offer, and a contact page, complete the picture.</p>
<p><a href="http://themes.muffingroup.com/be/couturier/"><img  title="" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2797" src="http://muffingroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/6-2.jpg"  alt="6-2 November – The Latest Pre-Built Websites"  width="1000" height="413" srcset="https://muffingroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/6-2.jpg 1000w, https://muffingroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/6-2-700x289.jpg 700w, https://muffingroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/6-2-260x107.jpg 260w, https://muffingroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/6-2-50x21.jpg 50w, https://muffingroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/6-2-150x62.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p><em>                     Clothes made in the couturier’s studio are highlighted in the gallery.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a href="http://themes.muffingroup.com/be/surveyor/"><strong>Be Surveyor</strong></a> – <strong>A corporate presentation pre-built website</strong></h3>
<p>At first glance, this pre-built website’s content would appear to cover all aspects of the surveying business quite well. There are however, many different ways in which the services of surveyors and surveying companies are rendered.</p>
<p>Consequently, when we designed and built BeSurveyor, our approach was to make it easy to transform and customize the branding and content, to be certain it will be easy to use for the entire spectrum of surveying business clients.</p>
<p><a href="http://themes.muffingroup.com/be/surveyor/"><img  title="" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2798" src="http://muffingroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/7-2.jpg"  alt="7-2 November – The Latest Pre-Built Websites"  width="1000" height="413" srcset="https://muffingroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/7-2.jpg 1000w, https://muffingroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/7-2-700x289.jpg 700w, https://muffingroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/7-2-260x107.jpg 260w, https://muffingroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/7-2-50x21.jpg 50w, https://muffingroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/7-2-150x62.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>On the home page, you will see the areas that communicate basic information about the company and its services. Past and present clients and testimonials are features many business will want to include, and these could easily be incorporated if desired.</p>
<p>The menu includes the about page, the services page, a certificates page, and a contact page. The services page makes good use of modern icons and white space while providing the basic information a potential client might be looking for.</p>
<p>A certificates page is an especially important feature for businesses operating in the surveying domain. In this case, the user can open a PDF file to display any of several certificates. The contact page nicely presents all the information a potential client needs – including a map, telephone number and address, and an e-mail form.</p>
<p><a href="http://themes.muffingroup.com/be/surveyor/"><img  title="" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2799" src="http://muffingroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/8-1.jpg"  alt="8-1 November – The Latest Pre-Built Websites"  width="1000" height="413" srcset="https://muffingroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/8-1.jpg 1000w, https://muffingroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/8-1-700x289.jpg 700w, https://muffingroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/8-1-260x107.jpg 260w, https://muffingroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/8-1-50x21.jpg 50w, https://muffingroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/8-1-150x62.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p><em>            Custom, domain-oriented icons helps to convey a corporate, yet friendly, atmosphere</em>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pre-built websites, give the designer the opportunity to get a project off to a rapid start, and going in the right direction. These useful tools also can serve as conceptual design elements. The layouts will impress clients, and designers can use them as solid, customizable, starting points.</p>
<p>There is however, much more involved in website design than simply customizing a layout that is ready for you to use. This is true for most business niches, including restaurants, food delivery services, or bakers.</p>
<p>Key factors include the details necessary to enhance the user experience (UX), the selection of conceptual components that emphasize a particular business’s look and feel, and marketing-related components, including a business’s unique value proposition, and a call to action, whether it is overt or implied.</p>
<p>E-commerce sites have many things in common from a designer’s perspective, but each niche, as is definitely the case with restaurant/food delivery businesses, has its unique characteristics; as you will see.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What are These Key Elements that Make a Restaurant or Food Related Business Website Not Just Good, but Outstanding?</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>UX Design</strong></p>
<p>UX design must first and foremost address the goals of the user. A user visiting a website has one or more goals in mind. They could include the need to reserve a table, determine a restaurants location, browsing the fare on a menu; or all of the above.</p>
<p>If any of these goals is not readily attainable, the user will likely go elsewhere. Two of the prerequisites of UX design are clean, crisp content, and easy navigation.</p>
<p><a href="http://themes.muffingroup.com/be/kebab/our-menu/" rel="nofollow"><strong>Be Kebab</strong></a></p>
<p><a href="http://themes.muffingroup.com/be/kebab/our-menu/" rel="nofollow"><img  title="" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2469" src="http://muffingroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/1.jpg"  alt="1 Pre-Built Websites for Restaurants and Food Delivery Businesses"  width="800" height="330" srcset="https://muffingroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/1.jpg 800w, https://muffingroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/1-700x289.jpg 700w, https://muffingroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/1-260x107.jpg 260w, https://muffingroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/1-50x21.jpg 50w, https://muffingroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/1-150x62.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></p>
<p>This, the newest addition to the Be Theme family, is a modern pre-built website with a fresh feel. It illustrates the main products and a selection from the menu.</p>
<p><strong>Good Photography</strong></p>
<p>Food related advertisements tend to rely heavily on photos. The photos need to be of superb quality, they need to be a meaningful part of the overall web design, and they need to balance a page, so it does not become cluttered or noisy.</p>
<p>Cool animation can play a valuable role in many types of websites. This one, on the homepage of <a href="http://themes.muffingroup.com/be/pizza/" rel="nofollow"><strong>Be Pizza</strong></a>, shows how food and drink are arranged on a table; centering of course on a mouth-watering pizza, accompanied by a glass of cold soda, and a red sauce dip or topping.</p>
<p><a href="http://themes.muffingroup.com/be/pizza/" rel="nofollow"><img  title="" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2470" src="http://muffingroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2.jpg"  alt="2 Pre-Built Websites for Restaurants and Food Delivery Businesses"  width="800" height="330" srcset="https://muffingroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2.jpg 800w, https://muffingroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2-700x289.jpg 700w, https://muffingroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2-260x107.jpg 260w, https://muffingroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2-50x21.jpg 50w, https://muffingroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2-150x62.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></p>
<p>Animation brings the user a step closer to a familiar restaurant atmosphere. Animation can be used to create a subtle, yet powerful, call to action.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Focus on the Menu</strong></p>
<p>First-time visitors to a restaurant’s website are most likely to want to see what the menu has to offer before making a reservation. While it would make little sense to clutter up a home page with a full menu, a practical alternative is to show images of best-selling items, as is the case with this burger delivery business’s home page.</p>
<p><a href="http://themes.muffingroup.com/be/burger/" rel="nofollow"><strong>Be Burger</strong></a></p>
<p><a href="http://themes.muffingroup.com/be/burger/" rel="nofollow"><img  title="" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2471" src="http://muffingroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/3.jpg"  alt="3 Pre-Built Websites for Restaurants and Food Delivery Businesses"  width="800" height="330" srcset="https://muffingroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/3.jpg 800w, https://muffingroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/3-700x289.jpg 700w, https://muffingroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/3-260x107.jpg 260w, https://muffingroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/3-50x21.jpg 50w, https://muffingroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/3-150x62.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Focus on Brand and Identity</strong></p>
<p>The logo and the color selection, along with the choice of a pre-designed website, needs to covey the atmosphere of the restaurant, or the essence of the restaurant delivery service.</p>
<p>Since food is the common topic, a proper choice of colors is absolutely vital; especially so in the presentation of food items. Color and imagery play a more important role in this business niche than in almost any other, with the possible exception of design agencies.</p>
<p><strong>Detail is also important.</strong> A typical restaurant’s menu will generally provide the information people look for; without overdoing it.</p>
<p>A proper use of white space can play a meaningful role by giving each menu item its allotted space, rather than by cramming everything together. A “clean” menu, one that is easy to browse, will say a lot about an eating establishment or a delivery service.</p>
<p><a href="http://themes.muffingroup.com/be/restaurant/book-a-table/" rel="nofollow"><strong>Be Restaurant</strong></a></p>
<p><strong> <a href="http://themes.muffingroup.com/be/restaurant/book-a-table/" rel="nofollow"><img  title="" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2472" src="http://muffingroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/4.jpg"  alt="4 Pre-Built Websites for Restaurants and Food Delivery Businesses"  width="800" height="330" srcset="https://muffingroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/4.jpg 800w, https://muffingroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/4-700x289.jpg 700w, https://muffingroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/4-260x107.jpg 260w, https://muffingroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/4-50x21.jpg 50w, https://muffingroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/4-150x62.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://themes.muffingroup.com/be/baker/" rel="nofollow"><strong>Be Bakery</strong></a> is another example of a pre-designed website that gives viewers the warm, cozy feeling they like to associate with small businesses. Here is a good example of a smart use of white space and icon design.</p>
<p>Be Bakery provides an excellent starting point for a website that will accurately reflects a client’s values.</p>

<p>UX design, great photography, menu presentation, and presenting a just-right look and feel, are key factors when designing a website for a client’s restaurant or food delivery service.</p>
<p>When all of these items are addressed properly, a home page can be used as a subtle call to action by engaging a visitor, and encouraging that visitor to find out more or guiding the visitor to where he or she wishes to go.</p>
